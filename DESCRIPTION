Description: 
    An HTML widget that randomly tours 2D projections of numerical data. A random walk through projections of the data is shown. The user can manipulate the plot to use specified axes, or turn on projection pursuit to find an informative projection of the data. Groups within the data can be hidden or shown, as can particular axes. Known projections of interest can be added as "extra axes" and also manipulated. The underlying method to produce the random walk and projection pursuit uses Langevin dynamics. The widget can be used from within R, or included in a self-contained Rmarkdown document, or used in a Shiny app.
