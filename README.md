# langevitour

langevitour is an HTML widget that randomly tours projections of a high-dimensional dataset with an animated scatter-plot. The user can manipulate the plot to use specified axes, or turn on Guided Tour mode to perform [projection pursuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projection_pursuit), finding an informative projection of the data. Groups within the data can be hidden or shown, as can particular axes. Known projections of interest can be added as "extra axes" and also manipulated. The widget can be used from within R or Python, or included in a self-contained Rmarkdown document, or a Shiny app, or used directly from Javascript.

langevitour is a twist on the "tour" concept from software such as [XGobi](https://lib.stat.cmu.edu/general/XGobi/), [GGobi](http://ggobi.org/), [tourr](http://ggobi.github.io/tourr/), [ferrn](https://huizezhang-sherry.github.io/ferrn/), [liminal](https://sa-lee.github.io/liminal/), [detourr](https://casperhart.github.io/detourr/index.html), [spinifex](https://nspyrison.github.io/spinifex/), and [loon.tour](https://great-northern-diver.github.io/loon.tourr/). The new element in langevitour is the use of [Langevin Dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langevin_dynamics) to generate the sequence of projections.

## R installation

Release version:

```r
install.packages("langevitour")
```

Development version:

```r
remotes::install_github("pfh/langevitour")
```

To build the documentation site:

```r
install.packages(c("devtools", "pkgdown", "BiocManager"))
devtools::install_dev_deps()
BiocManager::install(c("airway", "org.Hs.eg.db", "edgeR", "limma"))

pkgdown::build_site()
```

## R usage

Example:

```r
library(langevitour)

data(zeiselPC)
langevitour(zeiselPC[,-1], zeiselPC$type)
```

* [R documentation.](https://logarithmic.net/langevitour/reference/)

<br>

## JavaScript usage

* Get started by viewing source on [this example](https://pfh.github.io/langevitour/example.html).
* [JavaScript documentation.](https://logarithmic.net/langevitour/jsdoc/)

The minified and bundled version can be found in `inst/htmlwidgets/lib/langevitour-pack.js`.

### ESM module with npm

If using [node](https://nodejs.org/) and `npm` for development, langevitour can be added with:

```bash
npm install langevitour
```

This provides the widget as a modern ESM module. In your HTML page you can import it with:

```
<script type="module">

import { Langevitour } from "langevitour";

// ...
</script>
```

You'll need to use a packager such as [parcel](https://parceljs.org/) or [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to use this. Please tell me if you run into any problems, I am fairly new to Javascript development. 

### ESM module without npm

To avoid using npm, you could use [skypack.dev](https://www.skypack.dev/). You will still need to serve your page with some sort of web-server, such as `python3 -m http.server`.

```
<script type="module">

import { Langevitour } from "https://cdn.skypack.dev/langevitour";

// ...
</script>
```

[Here](https://observablehq.com/d/56b34c363af4dbca) is an example using skypack in an Observable Notebook.

### JavaScript development

langevitour is written in TypeScript, which is compiled to JavaScipt, and then Webpack is used to produce a minified and bundled version. To make changes to the JavaScript side of langevitour, you will need to install [node](https://nodejs.org/), which includes the `npm` package manager. `npm` can then install the necessary build tools and dependencies. Build scripts are defined in `package.json` and used as below.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pfh/langevitour.git
cd langevitour

# Install required packages
npm install

# ... edit source in src/ directory ...

# Compile TypeScript modules in src/ to JavaScript modules in lib/.
# Produce minified bundle inst/htmlwidgets/lib/langevitour.js
npm run js-build

# Complete Javascript+R build and documentation process.
npm run build
```

For example, to define a new guide you would:

* Add a new gradient function in `src/guides.ts`. 
* Add it to the `gradTable` in `src/guides.ts`.
* Add it to the `guideSelect` select box in `src/langevitour.ts`.
* Run `npm run js-build` and the new guide should appear when you load `example.html`.

## Python installation

```bash
pip install langevitour
```

## Python usage 

```python
import numpy as np

from langevitour import Langevitour

# Generate a sample dataset
X = []
group = []
n = 20000

def r():
    return np.random.normal(0, 0.02)

for i in range(n):
    a = i/n * np.pi * 2
    X.append([
        10 + np.sin(a)/3 + r(),
        20 + np.sin(a*2)/3 + r(),
        30 + np.sin(a*3)/3,
        40 + np.sin(a*4)/3,
        50 + np.sin(a*5)/3
    ])
    group.append(int(i*4/n))

# Extra axes (specified as columns of a matrix)
extra_axes = [[1], [2], [0], [0], [0]]
extra_axes_names = ["V1+2*V2"]

tour = Langevitour(
    X,
    group=group,
    extra_axes=extra_axes,
    extra_axes_names=extra_axes_names,
    point_size=1,
)
tour.write_html("langevitour_plot.html")
```

langevitour also works in [jupyter notebooks](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pfh/langevitour/blob/main/py/examples/langevitour.ipynb).
