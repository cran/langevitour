```

As an example we will use measurements of penguins made at Palmer Station, Antarctica. 

Since the measurements are in different units, we supply an appropriate scaling.

```{r}
library(langevitour)
library(palmerpenguins)

completePenguins <- na.omit(penguins[,c(1,3,4,5,6)])
completePenguins

scale <- apply(completePenguins[,-1], 2, sd)*4

langevitour(completePenguins[,-1], completePenguins$species, scale=scale, pointSize=2)
```

Things to try:

* Drag labels onto the plot.
* Set point repulsion to "PCA".
* Experiment with "damping" and "heat".
* Hide measurements by unchecking the checkbox on their label.
